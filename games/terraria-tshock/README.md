terraria-tshock
==============

Requires a volume mapping to `/opt/terraria/logs`, `/opt/terraria/world`, and
`/opt/terraria/config`. These mappings MUST have a UID of `7777` on their
respective folders. On the first start, you can find your authcode in the volume
that maps to `/opt/terraria/config` in `authcode.txt`. Use this code as
suggested by [the developers](https://tshock.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSHOCKPLUGINS/Setting+Up+Your+Server)
to get superadmin privileges, and continue to set up your server as required.
